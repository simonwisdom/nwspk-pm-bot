## **Defining Civic and Political Technology**

Civic technology encompasses a broad range of digital tools and platforms designed to improve government services, promote citizen engagement, and address community challenges1. This technology plays a crucial role in the realization of "digital democracy," which aims to provide channels for individuals to engage democratically using digital routes1. It leverages advancements in technology to drive civic participation, boost governmental transparency, and elevate the standard of state services. Examples of civic technology include online platforms for reporting local issues, open data portals, and digital tools for participatory budgeting1. Furthermore, civic technologies can support "monitorial citizenship," a form of civic engagement focused on holding institutions accountable4.

Political technology, on the other hand, often focuses on the use of technology in political campaigns and elections5. Examples include online voter mobilization platforms, campaign finance tracking tools, and social media analytics for political messaging5. However, it's important to acknowledge that digital technology can also have negative impacts on democracy, such as the rise of populism and the polarization of public discourse7.

While distinct, the domains of civic and political technology often overlap. For instance, a platform facilitating voter registration can be considered both a civic and political technology3. This report acknowledges this intersection and explores evaluation approaches relevant to both domains.

To illustrate the diverse applications of civic and political technology, the following table provides a categorization with examples:

| Category | Description | Examples |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Civic Technology | Tools and platforms designed to improve government services, promote citizen engagement, and address community challenges. | Online platforms for reporting local issues, open data portals, digital tools for participatory budgeting. |
| Political Technology | Technology used in political campaigns and elections to mobilize voters, track campaign finance, and analyze social media. | Online voter mobilization platforms, campaign finance tracking tools, social media analytics for political messaging. |
| Hybrid Applications | Technologies that serve both civic and political purposes. | Platforms for voter registration, online forums for political deliberation. |

## **Key Variables in Evaluating Civic and Political Technology Projects**

Evaluating civic and political technology projects requires considering various factors beyond simple user statistics. Key variables include:

| Variable | Description |
| :---- | :---- |

### **Specific Evaluation Tools**

In addition to the above, several specific tools can be used to evaluate civic technology projects:

* **Indicators:** These measure concrete progress towards larger goals, such as the UN Sustainable Development Goals12.  
* **Certifications:** These signal a base level of quality or assurance based on a third party's evaluation12.  
* **Report cards and audits:** These provide systematic analyses to evaluate promises made by governments and other institutions and track the performance of programs and initiatives12.  
* **Needs assessments:** These determine the needs of a given population, and technology can help estimate needs before formal assessments12.  
* **Benchmarks:** These consist of baseline data gathered from related actors in a field, allowing project owners to compare their impact12.

## **Frameworks and Methodologies**

Several frameworks and methodologies can guide the evaluation of civic and political technology projects:

* **Contribution Analysis:** This theory-based approach uses a theory of change to assess how the project contributes to desired outcomes, considering contextual factors and underlying assumptions3.  
* **Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs):** RCTs, often considered the gold standard in evaluation, involve randomly assigning users to different groups (e.g., those with access to the technology and those without) to isolate the project's impact13.  
* **Civic Experience (CivX) Metrics:** This framework emphasizes evaluating the civic experience, considering factors like empowerment, equity, efficacy, and inclusion10.  
* **Barcelona Principles:** These principles provide guidelines for public relations measurement, emphasizing the importance of goal setting, qualitative and quantitative analysis, and measuring impact beyond outputs6.  
* **Challenge Model of Innovation:** This model uses open challenges to spur innovation and generate interest in a problem area from a variety of potential innovators14.  
* **Participatory Technology Assessment:** This approach emphasizes "thinking like a citizen" and involving citizens in the evaluation process to ensure that technology serves their needs and values15.
