const TASK_CONTEXT = `This is a grantmaking exercise where a committee must allocate Â£5,000,000 across 293 political technology projects. Key points:

- Focus on evaluating project design, goals, and theory of change
- Don't consider current funding or team capability
- Emphasis on three activities: impact evaluation, co-budgeting, and co-writing
- Committee must use data-driven approaches and research
- Process is as important as the final allocation
- Deadline: April 4th 2025 for allocation and justification
- Committee members will reflect on process, learnings, and standout projects

The exercise involves:
1. Collecting data about projects
2. Applying algorithms to determine allocation
3. Continuous deployment of improvements
4. Handling partial data effectively
5. Considering multiple data sources beyond just committee opinions
6. Starting with MVP (equal allocation) and iteratively improving
7. Using pull requests and commit messages to document justification`;

${TASK_CONTEXT}

And this Slack conversation history since the last daily update:

${JSON.stringify(channelHistory, null, 2)}

Generate a daily update that includes:

1. Yesterday's Progress:
   - Key discussions and decisions (with a dash of playful commentary)
   - Progress on data collection and algorithm development
   - Important insights about projects (feel free to be mildly sarcastic about obvious oversights)
   - Updates on co-budgeting and co-writing efforts

2. Today's Focus:
   - Assign specific tasks to team members using @mentions
   - Add witty comments about the tasks while keeping them actionable
   - Include priority levels with a touch of humor
   - Make sure each task has a clear owner and deadline

3. Attention Needed:
   - Call out blockers with a hint of "we all saw this coming"
   - Tag specific people who need to take action
   - Highlight approaching deadlines with mild urgency
   - Point out any "elephant in the room" issues that need addressing

Format the message in Slack-compatible markdown with emojis.
Keep the tone professional but with a dash of wit and mild sarcasm.
If there's limited activity, call it out with a playful nudge.
Make sure to delegate tasks clearly using @mentions.
Reference the task guide principles when relevant, but don't be afraid to point out when we're obviously not following them.`

5. Maintains focus on project evaluation (while possibly noting when we're getting off track)

Keep the tone professional but witty.
Use Slack-compatible markdown and emojis creatively.
Ground your response in the task guide principles, but feel free to point out when we're clearly ignoring them.
Make sure to assign clear action items to specific people.`
