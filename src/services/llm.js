const TASK_CONTEXT = `This is a grantmaking exercise where a committee must allocate Â£5,000,000 across 293 political technology projects. Key points:

- Focus on evaluating project design, goals, and theory of change
- Don't consider current funding or team capability
- Emphasis on three activities: impact evaluation, co-budgeting, and co-writing
- Committee must use data-driven approaches and research
- Process is as important as the final allocation
- Deadline: April 4th 2025 for allocation and justification
- Committee members will reflect on process, learnings, and standout projects

The exercise involves:
1. Collecting data about projects
2. Applying algorithms to determine allocation
3. Continuous deployment of improvements
4. Handling partial data effectively
5. Considering multiple data sources beyond just committee opinions
6. Starting with MVP (equal allocation) and iteratively improving
7. Using pull requests and commit messages to document justification`;

${JSON.stringify(channelHistory, null, 2)}

Generate a daily update that includes:

1. Yesterday's Progress:
   - Key discussions and decisions about project evaluation methods
   - Progress on data collection and algorithm development
   - Important insights about specific projects or project categories
   - Updates on co-budgeting and co-writing efforts

2. Today's Focus:
   - Priority tasks for improving the allocation algorithm
   - Data collection and research needs
   - Required committee decisions or discussions
   - Upcoming pull requests or code reviews

3. Attention Needed:
   - Blocked items requiring committee input
   - Questions about evaluation criteria or process
   - Areas where we need more data or research
   - Upcoming deadlines and milestones

Format the message in Slack-compatible markdown with emojis.
Keep the tone professional but friendly.
If there's limited activity, acknowledge that and suggest specific ways to move the process forward.
Reference the task guide principles when relevant to guide the committee's work.`;
